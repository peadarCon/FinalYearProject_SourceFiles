    var setUp = "For this exercise you'll need access to a flat bench, a barbell and weights"
    var form = " 1) Lie flat on your back on the bench. \n 2) Grip the bar with hands just wider than shoulder-width apart, so when youâ€™re at the bottom of your move your hands are directly above your elbows. This allows for maximum force generation. \n 3) Bring the bar slowly down to your chest as you breathe in. \n 4) Push up as you breathe out, gripping the bar hard and watching a spot on the ceiling rather than the bar, so you can ensure it travels the same path every time."
